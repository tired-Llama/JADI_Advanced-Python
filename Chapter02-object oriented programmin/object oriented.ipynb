    "## Lambda function, filter, and map\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce a new type of function in advanced Python topics called lambda function . These functions are single-use and can be defined as anonymous. The way to define these functions is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A= Lambda x: x*2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three key components to defining this type of function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first component is the lambda function keyword , which tells Python that we are defining this specific type of function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second component is the function input argument, which comes after the word lambda and represents the function input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third component is the definition of the operation within the function, which is placed as an expression after the : sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the function A as above, we can call this function as A(x) to apply the commands defined by the programmer to the input parameters specific to the function. One of the important uses of these functions is to use them as filter and map functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will talk about two important features in advanced Python: filter commands and map function in Python .\n",
    "\n",
    "The map function in Python allows you to apply a function to all members of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of map is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "map(function, list_name)          \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first input to the map command is a function to be applied to the list, usually a lambda function, and the second input to the command is the name of the list to which the function is applied. map( lambda x: x**2, items)\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter function works similarly to the map function, except that it allows you to check a condition on all members of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "filter( lambda x: x < 0, number_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, filters, like maps, have two inputs. The first input is a lambda function that defines the desired condition, and the second input is the name of the list that this condition is applied to. The output of this command is a list of items where the function value was true.\n",
    "\n",
    "## generator functions yield in Python\n",
    "In this section, we will talk about some types of advanced functions in Python. One of these functions is the generator function . These functions are used for iteration. These functions are very similar to normal functions in Python. One of the differences between these functions is the use of the yield statement instead of return when getting output from functions. The difference between return and yield is that when using return, the entire function stops, but when we use the yield statement. The function in question is paused and stores the values ​​and states, and later, when called from the continuation of the states, it starts executing the function. This feature helps our programs to run faster and also consumes the memory used by programs more efficiently.\n"

    "## Introduction to object oriented programming\n",
    "In this section, we discuss the concept of advanced object-oriented programming  . In object-oriented programming, all values ​​and behaviors are placed in an entity called an object. The object-oriented programming method is contrasted with the functional or procedural programming method, which is in the form of functions and program blocks that are executed sequentially. In object-oriented programming, it was given the opportunity to put similar items into a class and create as many objects of that class with the same characteristics as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "These objects have a series of variables that are like the characteristics of a person, such as age, height, name, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties are called Class attributes in object-oriented programming. Also, these objects in Python have their own behaviors that are attributed to these objects in the form of functions. In object-oriented programming, these functions are called methods. These fields and methods are placed inside a structure called a class. Classes contain information about objects and with their help, objects can be created and used. In object-oriented programming, we first need to create an object from a class. After creating this object, we can use the class-specific variables and methods on this object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming helps programmers break down their problems into smaller components, increasing the speed and accuracy of programming and preventing unnecessary repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next session, we will discuss object-orientation in Python .\n",
    "\n",
    "[source proposed by Jadi](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### object oriented programming in pythons\n",
    "In this section, we will go into more detail about object-orientation in advanced Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the class statement is used to create a class. For example, we are going to create a class called person. In the topic of object orientation, we can use two types of variables. The first type is class variables, which are constant for all objects created from a class. The second type is object variables, which are related to the objects themselves. At the beginning of a class, after introducing the variables, the first function is the class constructor, which is defined as the method `(__init__)`. \\\n",
    "This method is automatically executed when an object is created from the class. To create an object from a class, the word new is used. When the word new is used, the class constructor function is executed and the commands inside the constructor are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important keyword in the discussion of object-oriented programming in advanced Python is the self statement, which is equivalent to the this statement in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression in programming refers to the same object. For example, self.name refers to the name variable of the created object. Usually, setter and getter functions are defined in classes to set and get the values ​​of variables. The setter function is used to set the values ​​of variables and receives the values ​​that we want to put in the class variables as input. The getter function is used to get the values ​​of class variables at the required time. \n",
    "#### The concept of inheritance in classes\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss the concept of inheritance in advanced Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of inheritance means that a class can use the features of another class and, so to speak, inherit from this class. For example, we have a class called Laptop that includes the features and behaviors related to a laptop. We have another class called Computer that has all the features of a laptop but also has its own unique features. In this case, in programming, we can use the features of the Computer class for objects of the laptop type and define only the unique features and behaviors of the laptop in the Laptop class. This feature is called inheritance in advanced Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Extends statement is used to specify a class that uses this feature. For example, to define that the Laptop class inherits from the Computer class, we would write:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Class laptop extends computer {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the concept of inheritance, the computer class from which another class inherits is called the parent class, and the class that extends another class, such as the laptop class, is called the child class. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the super() function so that the child class can access the properties and methods of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An example of object-oriented usage\n",
    "In this section, we will talk about an example of the use of object-oriented programming in Python  .\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the newest and youngest areas of technology in the world is the Internet of Things or IOT. Suppose that as a programmer you intend to implement the software part of an Internet of Things complex. In this situation, you have different devices, each of which is connected to the Internet with its own IP and Mac addresses and has its own specific name. Each of these devices has its own characteristics and behavior. For example, a television has a behavior that can be turned on and off, or a thermometer has a behavior that measures the temperature and provides it as an output to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we define a device class that defines all the common features of devices, including IP and MAC addresses, and the name of each device as properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define a method that checks whether each device is active or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define a special class for each device that inherits from the Device class and uses the features of this class, and also the special features of each separate class are defined in that class. For example, for a lamp device, it activates the light adjustment method, but the TV class does not require such a method.\n",

    "### Programming Exercise: Health Program\n",
    "Two different health programs are planned in two schools, A and B. Milk is distributed in one school and not in the other. Nutrition experts plan to compare the height, weight, and age of students in these two classes by examining their ages. Write a program that takes the number of students in each class, plus their ages, heights, and weights, stores each in a list, and prints the average age, heights, and weights of each class on a separate line in the output (printed as floats), and then prints the class with the highest average height in the output. (First, enter the number and information of class A, and then the information of class B. The output should also be printed in the order of the input information.) If the average height is equal, the class with the lowest average weight should be printed. If the average height and weight are equal, the statement Same (exactly the same) should be printed in the output.\n",
